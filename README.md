# SpaceX
Inspired by SpaceX launch system development program which is really a fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space.
The game begins with the inception of the gruesome situation which may arise in the future in which the inhabitants of the earth will have to emigrate from Earth to Mars ( which lies in habitable zone besides earth ) .
In the game the player has to emigrate 13 species ( for example) in three rounds .
First round starts with a little brain teasing exercise .In this the participant has to apply some logic and think how space X can get all the species to mars under certain conditions (like which species can remain together without harming each other ) . 
After solving the brain teaser the player has to crack a code or debug a code as fast as she/he can in order to get a better option for the spacecraft . In the journey to Mars there'll be numerous obstacles like asteroids , meteoroids which the player has to overcome by navigating the spacecraft accordingly (manually)...........Also in this expedition the player will get few opportunities to answer certain questions which will give the player a protective shield (that will protect the rocket from destruction due to collision with the non celestial bodies ) or a weapon like a lazer which can be used to destroy the obstacles encountered in the expedition . (This will also increase the player's points .)

Once the first round is completed the second round begins where the concept of reusable rockets of space X comes into picture . Now the rocket which is already launched to Mars has to be reused to take more species to mars and for that it has to land properly on earth . 
Now here again comes the technical part , in this the participant has to debug a code or solve some output questions within a particular time limit otherwise the rocket will crash while landing .
After safe landing of the rocket the player 
has to take the next group of species to Mars and the previous procedure repeats with a enhanced level of difficulty .
